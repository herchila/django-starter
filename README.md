# Django Quickstart Template

This is a basic Django project template to help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-project-name]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
